## Description:

In this project, we explore the use of machine learning algorithms and advanced feature selection methods to accurately predict customer churn in an e-commerce subscription-based men's health business.

## Notebooks

The repository includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

- `analysis.ipynb`: This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the dataset.

- `diss_fullset.ipynb`: This notebook contains the machine learning models trained on the full dataset.

- `diss_refined.ipynb`: This notebook contains the machine learning models trained on a refined dataset, which is a subset of the full dataset.

- `diss_further_refined.ipynb`: This notebook contains the machine learning models trained on a further refined dataset, which is a subset of the refined dataset.

- `RF_importance.ipynb`: This notebook contains the random forest model trained on a feature set selected based on feature importance.

## How to Use

To run these notebooks, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install it using the following command:

pip install jupyter notebook

You will also need to have the following Python packages installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

To install these packages, you can use pip similar to above.

Once you have installed Jupyter Notebook and the required packages, you can run the notebooks by navigating to the directory where the notebooks are saved and running the following command:

jupyter notebook

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, where you can click on the notebook you wish to run.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting customer churn in a subscription-based e-commerce business. The notebooks provided in this repository can serve as a reference for anyone interested in applying machine learning techniques to similar business problems.

The Random Forest model achieved the highest performance.
